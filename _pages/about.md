# About Me 
* I am a post-doctoral researcher at [IMT-Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr) working with Professors [Vincent Gripon](http://www.vincent-gripon.com), [Lucas Dumetz](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/person/lucas-drumetz) and [Bastien Pasdeloup](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=dKOgoG4AAAAJ&hl=en) on few-shot learning. Few-shot learning refers to the practice of feeding a learning model with a very small amount of training data, contrary to the normal practice of using a large amount of data. [[Curriculum Vitae](http://mouniahamidouche.github.io/files/mounia_cv.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mMEdVfoAAAAJ&hl=en)].

* My research interest  lie principally in the development of theoretical tools based on graph theory and graph signal processing to address the problems of interpretability / understanding / robustness of deep neural networks.

 * Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D  from [Nice Sophia Antipolis University](http://unice.fr/en) prepared at [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/fr) under the supervision of Dr. [Konstantin Avrachenkov](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Konstantin.Avratchenkov/me.html) and Prof. [Laura Cottatellucci](http://www.eurecom.fr/fr/people/cottatellucci-laura). In 2019, I was a visiting scholar at [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität (FAU)](https://www.fau.eu).
 

* My Ph.D work focused on the use of techniques from harmonic analysis and probability theory for the study of large random graphs. 


* I received my Bachlor's and Master’s degree from [USTHB](https://www.usthb.dz/en#slider) and [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr), respectively, both in applied mathematics.
