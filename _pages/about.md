# About Me
* I am a post-doctoral researcher at [ Department](https://cs.stanford.edu/) at [IMT-Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr), advised by Prof. [Vincent Gripon](http://www.vincent-gripon.com). [[Curriculum Vitae](http://lantaoyu.com/files/lantaoyu_cv.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mMEdVfoAAAAJ&hl=en)]
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, multi-task and meta-learning and multi-agent systems.
 * I obtained a PhD in Science and Technology in Information and Communication (STIC) at [EURECOM] (http://www.eurecom.fr/fr), advised by Prof. [konstantin avrachenkov](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Konstantin.Avratchenkov/me.html) and Prof. [Laura Cottatellucci](http://www.eurecom.fr/fr/people/cottatellucci-laura).
* I received my Master’s Degree from the [University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr), respectively. In 2019, I was a visiting scholar at [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität (FAU)](https://www.fau.eu).
