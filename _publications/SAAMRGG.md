## Abstract
In this article, we analyze the limiting eigenvalue distribution (LED) of random geometric graphs (RGGs). The RGG is constructed by uniformly distributing n nodes on the d-dimensional torus  and connecting two nodes if their distance,  is at most . In particular, we study the LED of the adjacency matrix of RGGs in the connectivity regime, in which the average vertex degree scales as log (n) or faster, i.e., . In the connectivity regime and under some conditions on the radius , we show that the LED of the adjacency matrix of RGGs converges to the LED of the adjacency matrix of a deterministic geometric graph (DGG) with nodes in a grid as n goes to infinity. Then, for n finite, we use the structure of the DGG to approximate the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the RGG and provide an upper bound for the approximation error.
